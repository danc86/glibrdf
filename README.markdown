# glib + librdf = glibrdf

This library is a small wrapper around the [Redland RDF library 
(librdf)](http://librdf.org/) to make it work nicely with 
[GLib](http://developer.gnome.org/glib/) and 
[Vala](https://live.gnome.org/Vala) and the rest of the GNOME ecosystem.

It consists mainly of the very thorough `redland.vapi` written by Sam 
Thursfield for his [Charango](https://github.com/ssssam/charango) library, with 
some fixes, plus a few extra bits.

Docs still to come...
